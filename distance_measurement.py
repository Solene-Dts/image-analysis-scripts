###Introduction

# Hi!

# Characteristics
	# written for Jython (Python 2.7 in ImageJ 2.9.0)
	# contact for help: solenedeutsch@gmail.com

# Aim of the script
	# Isolates vessels and T cells and measures the distance from each T cell to each vessel.

# Getting started
	# open the images you want to analyze with the "Split channel" box unchecked
		# the results of one run will all be put in the same text file
	# the results are written in a text file, in your choosen directory
	# the results are formatted to be compatible with the distance_analysis script to analyze them
	# a preliminary run with fewer images is required to make sure that all the thresholdings and detections are working correctly
	# this script selects the active image, analyzes it, and closes it. Make sure no useless image is opened in front.
	# the T cell detection works with Cellpose. See Cellpose-and-Cellpose-on-ImageJ Tutorial for more information.
	# you can change the name of the file at the bottom of the script (Saving results part)
	# This script currently asks user to check that the T cells detected are indeed T cells (and same for the vessels).
		# If you wnat to run the script without having to check, comment the lines where you see a WaitForUserDialog (2 of them)
	
# Have fun!
